        Organization Name: Google Drive <p>

        <p> This site uses Visual Hierarchy by first drawing your attention to the text by placing it in the center of the page and in large font. Right above that, you can see Google Drive's logo which also helps draw you attention to the text. Underneath the text you find two large boxes with font that is smaller than the text above them. Inside of those boxes is descriptions of each account using text that is smaller than thee titles of the boxes. Then underneath the descriptions is a blue button that has a similar size text to that of the title of the boxes. This depicts Visual Hierarchy because are eye can easily follow the different objects and their importance.

    <p> Spotify is the perfect example for White Space and Clean Design. On the home page, you see their logo, menu, and then a simple home page. On their home page they have their mission, and a button that enables you to sign up for their program for free. Surrounding that text is White Space. It is a clean design that is very eye catching.

    <p>
        The Church of Jesus Christ depicts Alignment very well. On the home page, everything is aligned with eachother. This makes the home page look very clean. It also makes it easy to navigate through the different pages that are linked on to the homepage.
